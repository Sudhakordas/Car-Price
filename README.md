## Introduction
This is completly a end to end machine learning project. Where i trained various machine learning algorithms with the car predictions dataset from kaggle to predict the dataset.
Then choose the best algorithm interms of mean-squared-error. Then convert this project into a web app by using  Flask and html. Finall deploy it into heroku platfrom.

## Demo
