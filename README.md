## Introduction
This is completly a end to end machine learning project. Where i trained various machine learning algorithms with the car predictions dataset from kaggle to predict the dataset.
Then choose the best algorithm interms of mean-squared-error. Then convert this project into a web app by using  Flask and html. Finall deploy it into heroku platfrom.

## Demo
Link of the web app: [https://car-ml-app.herokuapp.com/](https://car-ml-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Workflow
1. After collecting the data handled missing values and drop the unnecessary columns.  
2. Analyse the data with help of some data visualization tools like matplotlib, sklearn to draw some insight from the data.
3. Apply some feature engineering technique(get the dummy values).
4. Apply various machine learning algorithms and selected the best one with less error and the tuned it.
5. Used  basic html to make the fronted and Flask to make the backend.
6. Finally deployed it in thte heroku platfrom.
